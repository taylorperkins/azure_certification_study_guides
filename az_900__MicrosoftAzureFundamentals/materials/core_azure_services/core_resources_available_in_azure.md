## Virtual Machines

- software emulations of physical computers
- processors, memory, storage, and networking
- host an operating system and can run software like a normal. computer
- IaaS
- Ideal when you need: 
	- total control over the OS
	- ability to run custom software
	- use custom hosting config
- Use pre-configured _images_ (template used to create a VM)
	- Already include OS and other software like dev tools or web hosting environments
- When to use VMs
	- During testing and development
	- running apps in the cloud
	- Extending datacenter to the cloud (such as sharepoint)
	- during disaster recovery


## VM Scale Sets

- manage sets of identical, load-balanced VMs
- Used to scale VM
- designed to support true autoscale
- no pre-provisioning required
- centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes to provide highly available applications
- number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule
- build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.


## Batch

- large scale parallel and high-performance computing
- when running a job, batch will:
	- start a pool of VMs for you
	- install apps and staging data
	- runs jobs with as many tasks as you have
	- identifies failures
	- re-queues work
	- scales down as pool completes


## Containers

- Used to manage and deploy containers
- Multiple instances of a container in a host machine
- What is a container?
	- virtualization environment. Containers control the OS whereas VMs control the hardware
- Generally used in microservice architecture which allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently.



## Container Instances 

- fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure
- PaaS


## Kubernetes

- Orchestrating is the task of automating, managing, and interacting with a large number of containers. 
- handles the orchestration of containers
- Typicallly used in a microservice architecture


## App Services

- PaaS
- Build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. 
- Offers automatic scaling and high availability. 
- Supports Windows and Linux and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model.
- Host most common app service styles like: 
	- Web apps: ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python with Windows or Linux as the host operating system
	- API apps: REST-based web APIs by using your choice of language and framework. full Swagger support and the ability to package and publish your API in Azure Marketplace. HTTP- or HTTPS-based client
	- WebJobs: run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python, or Node.js) or script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app through a schedule or trigger
	- Mobile Apps
- handles most of the infrastructure decisions you deal with in hosting web-accessible apps:
	- Deployment and management are integrated into the platform.
	- Endpoints can be secured.
	- Sites can be scaled quickly to handle high traffic loads.

- Users have the freedom to connect to Windows Virtual Desktop with any device over the internet
- Simplifies management, gives options to load balance users on a VM host pool, users can have multiple sessions


# Describe the benefits and usage of Virtual Networks, VPN Gateway, Virtual Network peering, and ExpressRoute

## VNet Peering

- enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other. These virtual networks can be in separate regions, which allows you to create a global interconnected network through Azure.
- UDR (user-defined Routing) is a significant update to Azureâ€™s Virtual Networks as this allows network admins to control the routing tables between subnets within a subnet as well as between VNets thereby allowing for greater control over network traffic flow.

## Virtual Networks

- Generally provides the key networking capabilities: 
	- Isolation and segmentation
	- Internet communications
	- Communicate between Azure resources
	- Communicate with on-premises resources
	- Route network traffic
	- Filter network traffic
	- Connect virtual networks
- Enables resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate to one another, with users on the internet, and with your on-prem client computers
- Provide the following capabilities:
	- Isolation and segmentation
		- Define private IP by using either private or public IP ranges
		- Further divide that range into subnets and allocate part of the defined space to each named subnet
	- Internet communications
		- VMs can connect to the internet by default
		- Enable incoming connections from the internet by defining a public IP or public load balancer
	- Communication between Azure resources
		- Virtual networks
			- Connect to other VMs as well as other resources
		- Service Endpoints
			- Connect to other resource types, such as databases and storage accounts
	- Communication with on-premises resources
		- Point-to-site virtual private networks
		- site-to-site virtual private networks
		- azure express route
			- env that need greater bandwidth and higher levels of security 
			- doesn't travel over the internet
	- Route network traffic
		- Route tables: define rules about how traffic should be directed. Create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets
		- Border gateway control
	- Filter network traffic
		- Network security groups
		- network virtual appliances
	- Connect VN
		- Using virtual network peering
			- enables resources in each Vnet to communicate with each other
		- User defined routing (UDR)
			- allows network admins to control the routing tables between subnets within a subnet as well as between VNets
	- Creating Virtual Networks
		- Address space: Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) format
		- Network name
		- subscription
		- resource group: virtual network needs to exist in a resource group
		- location
		- subnet: you can create one or more subnets that partition the virtual network's address space. Routing between subnets will then depend on the default traffic routes. You also can define custom routes. Alternatively, you can define one subnet that encompasses all the virtual networks' address ranges.
		- DDoS protection: Basic or Standard DDoS protection
		- Service Endpoints: enable service endpoints such as Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, Azure Key Vault, and so on
		- Network SG: enable you to filter the type of network traffic that can flow in and out of virtual network subnets and network interfaces.
		- Route table


## VPN Gateway Fundamentals

- type of private interconnected network that uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. 
- generally, they are deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network.
- enable the following activity:
	- Connect on-prem data centers to Vnets through site-to-site connections
	- Connect individual devices to Vnets through a point-to-site conn
	- Connect Vnets to other virtual networks through a network-to-network conn
- Policy-based VPNs
	- Specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel
	- Supports IKEv1 only
	- Use of static routing
	- must be used in specific scenarios that require them
- Route based VPN
	- Use when you need:
		- Connections between VNets
		- Point-to-site connections
		- multisite connections
		- coexistence with an azure ExpressRoute Gateway
- Requires:
	- VNet
	- GatewaySubnet
	- Public IP
	- Localnetwork Gateway
	- Connection


## ExpressRoute

- Lets you extend on prem networks into the cloud over a private connection.
- Lets you establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure and Microsoft 365
- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model:
	- Layer 2 (L2): 
		- Data Link Layer, which provides node-to-node communication between two nodes on the same network.
	- Layer 3 (L3): 
		- Network Layer, which provides addressing and routing between nodes on a multi-node network.
- features and benefits:
	- Layer 3: any IPVPN network, point-to-point ethernet, or through a virtual cross-connection
	- connectivity to cloud services across all regions and geopolitical region
	- Global conenctivity to services
		- CloudExchange colocation
