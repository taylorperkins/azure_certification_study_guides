# Describe the shared responsibility model


# Describe serverless computing

- Similar to PaaS in that it eliminates the need to manage infrastructure
- Cloud service automatically scales, provisions, and manages infrastructure
- Highly scalable, event driven
- Servers are still running code


# Identify a service type based on a use caseAgility


# Describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

- Most flexible, complete control over hardware
- No CapEx
- Agility: Applications can be made accessible quickly, and deprovisioned whenever needed.
- Management: shared responsibility model applies
- Consumption-based model: OpEx model
- Skills. No deep technical skills are required. Organizations can use the skills and expertise of the cloud provider
- Cloud benefits. Organizations can use the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure workloads are made secure and highly available.
- Flexibility. IaaS is the most flexible cloud service because you have control to configure and manage the hardware running your application.
- Closest to managing physical servers
- Cloud provider keeps hardware up-to-date, OS and networking is up to cloud tenant
- Example: Azure VM


# Describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

- Same benefits as IaaS
- No CapEx
- Agility. PaaS is more agile than IaaS, and users don't need to configure servers for running applications.
- Consumption-based model: OpEx
- No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain the benefits of PaaS.
- Users can take advantage of the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure that their workloads are made secure and highly available. In addition, users can gain access to more cutting-edge development tools. They can then apply these tools across an application's lifecycle.
- Productivity. Users can focus on application development only, because the cloud provider handles all platform management.
- Managed hosting environment
- Provider manages VM and networking resources, cloud tenant deploys apps in managed hosting env
- Example: Azure App Services
- Disadvantage: Platform limitations


# Describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

- Centrally hosted and managed by cloud provider
- One version of product for all customers
- No CapEx
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- Provider manages all aspects of app environment, such as VM, networking, data storage, and apps. Cloud tenant only provides their data
- Example: Office 365
- Disadvantage: Software limitations (such as versions with as-is-software)
