# Identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, and Disaster Recovery

Several advantages cloud environments have over physical environment:
- High Availability: continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong
- Scalability
	- Vertically: Â increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine
	- Horizontally: increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration
- Elasticity: take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need
- Agility: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change
- Geo_distribution: deploy apps and data to regional data centers around the globe, ensuring best performance in different regions


# Identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

- Capital Expenditure (CapEx) 
	- Up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure, then deducting that up-front expense over time
	- Value reduces over time
	- Examples include: owning your own infrastructure, buying equipment that goes into balance sheets or assets. Assets get depreciated or amoritized

- Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
	- Spending money on services or products now, and being billed for them now
	- Deduct the expense the same year you spend it
	- No up-front cost
	- Consumption-based model


# Describe the consumption-based model

- End users only pay for the resources they use.
- Benefits include: 
	- No upfront costs.
	- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
	- The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
	- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
